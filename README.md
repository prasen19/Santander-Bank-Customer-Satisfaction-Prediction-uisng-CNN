# Santander-Bank-Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction-uisng-CNN

1. Santander Bank wants to know whether their customers are satisfied or dissatisfied
with the bank’s service.
2. A Convolutional Neural Network is designed with Keras in Tensorflow 2 to predict
whether each customer is satisfied or not with bank’s service.
3. This was a Kaggle competition and dataset was made available by Santander on Kaggle.
4. The highest accuracy achieved on Kaggle for the Public testing dataset is around 85%
but this project has achieved accuracy of around 95%.
